## Sequence Models

# Week01
# Sequence Models - Notation

Sequence models are used where the **order of the input** plays an important role in predicting the output.  
Examples include:
- Speech recognition  
- Time series prediction  
- Music generation  
- Sentiment analysis  
## Notation
Let's consider an example sentence:

> **"My name is Manish Jyani"**

Input Representation
- Inputs: `x<1>, x<2>, x<3>, x<4>`
- Total input length: `T_x = 4`
- Here, `x` represents the input.

Output Representation
- Similarly, `y` represents the output.
- Total output length: `T_y`.

Generalized Notation
- `x^i<t>` → The **t-th element** in the **i-th training example**.  
- Here, `t` stands for **temporal position** in the sequence.

# Gotcha Moment ⚡
- In sequence inputs, when we refer to the **previous time step**, it means the **previous word** (on the left side).  
- `x<t-1>` lies to the **left** of `x<t>`.  
- There is **no actual concept of time** here; `t` is just a positional reference.
